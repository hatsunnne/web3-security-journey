<h1 align="center">web3 security journey</h1>

<p align="center">
  started on february 17, 2026 — i am 16 years old and i have no idea what i am doing yet
</p>

i got into web3 because i think it is genuinely one of the most interesting things happening right now. the idea that code holds real money, that a single bug can cost millions, and that a person sitting alone can find it before anyone else does — that is insane to me in the best way. i want to be that person.

this repository is my attempt to get there from absolute zero.

**how this works**

every day i study, i drop a file in `./days/`. it can be notes, a ctf writeup, a contract i read, something i broke, something i learned. no fixed format, just whatever happened that day.

the goal is to keep going until i get my first job as a web3 security auditor.
