# day 01 — blockchain basics

**date:** february 15, 2026
**course:** [Cyfrin Updraft — Blockchain Basics](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/)

---

## what i did today

marathoned the entire blockchain basics section of the cyfrin updraft course. it was a lot but it clicked pretty well. below are my notes on the most important concepts.

---

## what is a blockchain

a blockchain is a database that is shared and synchronized across thousands of computers. instead of one company owning the data, everyone has a copy. to change anything, the network has to agree.

  <sub>each block contains data, a hash, and the hash of the previous block</sub>
</p>

---

## blocks and hashes

every block has three things: some data (transactions), its own hash (like a fingerprint), and the hash of the block before it. this chain of hashes is what makes it tamper-proof — if you change one block, all the hashes after it break.

---

## nodes and decentralization

a node is just a computer participating in the network. there is no central server. the more nodes there are, the harder it is to attack or shut down the network. this is what decentralization actually means in practice.

## consensus mechanisms

this is how the network agrees on which transactions are valid without trusting any single person.

### proof of work (PoW)

miners compete to solve a hard math puzzle. the first one to solve it gets to add the next block and earns a reward. it works, but it uses an insane amount of energy. bitcoin still uses this.

</p>

the idea behind the puzzle is that it makes cheating expensive. if you want to rewrite history, you need more computing power than the entire honest network combined — a 51% attack.

---

### proof of stake (PoS)

instead of competing with computing power, validators lock up (stake) their own crypto as collateral. they get chosen to validate blocks based on their stake. if they try to cheat, they lose their stake — this is called slashing. ethereum switched to this in 2022.

way more energy efficient than PoW. the tradeoff people debate is whether it makes the rich more powerful since bigger stake = more influence.

---

## wallets and keys

your wallet does not actually store your crypto. it stores your private key, which proves you own whatever is on-chain.

- **private key** — a secret number. whoever has it controls the funds. never share it.
- **public key** — derived from the private key. used to generate your address.
- **address** — what you share with others to receive funds. like an email but for money.

the math that connects private key → public key is one-way. you can go forward but not backward. this is elliptic curve cryptography.

---

## gas

every transaction on ethereum costs gas. gas is the fee paid to validators for including your transaction. when the network is busy, gas goes up. when it is quiet, it drops.

---

## smart contracts

programs that live on the blockchain. they run automatically when conditions are met, with no middleman. this is what makes ethereum different from bitcoin — it is programmable money.

i will go much deeper on these soon since they are basically everything in web3 security.

---

## overall feeling

blockchain basics makes a lot of sense conceptually. the interesting part for security is already showing up — immutability means bugs are forever, keys mean custody, and smart contracts mean code is law. a lot of pressure on getting it right.

**tomorrow:** going deeper into ethereum and how the EVM works.
