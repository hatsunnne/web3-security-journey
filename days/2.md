# day 02 — blockchain basics (finishing up)

**date:** february 16, 2026
**course:** [Cyfrin Updraft — Blockchain Basics](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/)

## what i did today

finished the remaining parts of blockchain basics. shorter day, mostly practical stuff.

## signing transactions

when you send a transaction, your wallet signs it with your private key. this signature proves you authorized it without ever revealing the private key itself. the network can verify the signature using your public key.

the algorithm behind this is ECDSA (elliptic curve digital signature algorithm). you do not need to understand the math deeply right now, just know that signatures are how ownership is proven on-chain.

## testnets

testnets are copies of a blockchain that use fake money. you deploy and test contracts there before going to mainnet where everything is real. the main ones for ethereum are Sepolia and Holesky.

you get fake ETH from faucets — websites that just send you some for free. this is where you practice without risking anything.

## layer 2s

ethereum mainnet is slow and expensive when congested. layer 2s are networks built on top of ethereum that process transactions faster and cheaper, then bundle them and settle back to mainnet.

the two main approaches are:
- **optimistic rollups** — assume transactions are valid, allow a challenge window. examples: Optimism, Arbitrum.
- **zk rollups** — use cryptographic proofs to verify transactions. examples: zkSync, Starknet.

for security purposes, each L2 has its own quirks and attack surface. something to come back to later.

## overall feeling

blockchain basics is done. it was a good foundation — nothing too deep yet but now i have the vocabulary to actually read about vulnerabilities without getting lost.

**tomorrow:** starting Solidity fundamentals.
