# day 03 — introduction to solidity

**date:** february 17, 2026
**course:** [Cyfrin Updraft — Solidity Fundamentals](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/)

---

## what i did today

started solidity. did not write much code yet — mostly understood the context of what smart contracts actually are and how solidity fits in before jumping into syntax.

---

## smart contracts

a smart contract is a program that lives on the blockchain. once deployed, it runs exactly as written — no one can change it, stop it, or interfere with it. not even the person who deployed it (unless they coded in a way to do so).

this is what makes them powerful and dangerous at the same time. there is no "undo". if there is a bug, it is there forever unless the contract has an upgrade mechanism built in.

smart contracts are the entire attack surface of web3 security. every audit is basically reading one of these and asking — where does this break?

---

## what solidity is

solidity is the main language for writing smart contracts on ethereum and most EVM-compatible chains. it looks a lot like javascript but compiles down to bytecode that runs on the EVM.

the EVM (ethereum virtual machine) is the environment where all contracts execute. every node runs the same EVM, which is why results are deterministic — the same input always gives the same output, everywhere.

---

## how deployment works

you write solidity code, compile it into bytecode, and deploy it to the network by sending a special transaction. the contract gets its own address and lives there forever. anyone can interact with it by calling its functions.

---

## accounts

there are two types of accounts on ethereum:

- **EOA (externally owned account)** — a regular wallet controlled by a private key. this is what people use.
- **contract account** — a smart contract. it has an address and can hold ETH, but it only acts when called.

---

## remix

started using Remix IDE — it is a browser-based editor for solidity. no setup needed, just open it and start writing. good for learning, most people move to Foundry later for serious work.

---

## overall feeling

solidity feels approachable so far. the scary part is not the syntax — it is the consequences. code that holds real money with no safety net. that mindset shift is what i think separates a security researcher from a regular developer.

**tomorrow:** actual solidity syntax — variables, types, functions.
